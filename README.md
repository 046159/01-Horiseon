# Challenge 1 - Refactor existing code to make it more accessible

## Description 

This project was to take an excisting piece of code and to refactor it to make it more accessible and also to tidy up the associated CSS file so that it is more consolidated. Accessibility is not only important for search engine optimisation (SEO), but to make the website accessible to everyone. Accessibility was enhanced by using semantic tags where it made sense to do so. Through this exercice I learnt what makes a website more accessible and discovered online tools that helped with validating this.

## Usage 

Instructions for using the website will be added here once the website has been developed further. At the moment the code only displays the homepage. Below is a screenshot of the website as it currently stands:



To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:
